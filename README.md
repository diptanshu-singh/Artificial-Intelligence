Artificial Intelligence is a process of Perception, Reasoning and Action. I am interested in the mathematics that goes behind each of these methods. This webpage is my attempt to explore applications and implementation of simple algorithms that solve complex problems. I'm an enthusiast of Intepretable Machine Learning, and I believe in DeepMinds motto -  

<blockquote>Solve Intelligence. Use it to make world a better place</blockquote>
